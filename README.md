# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
The initial commit I followed along this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpvtZZi5ZWk&ab_channel=JavaScriptMastery

Plans to add to make it part of my portfolio:
- accordion component for each link searched which shows the URL, and the summary
- have the summary be formatted nicely
- include animations
- 
Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
